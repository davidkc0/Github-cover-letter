Greetings! 

I am very excited about the opportunity of interning at Github next summer, because for me my journey to learn to code, and Github are closely connected. Github was there when programming [first really clicked for me](https://github.com/davidkc0/tapedec). I was watching a video series on Ruby on Rails, and the instructor made it a point to always commit to Github. At the time it seemed like and unnecessary extra step, but I was extremely grateful for it when I realized how powerful it was. I used it like a shoulder to lean on.  Github was there when I made my [first iPhone app](https://github.com/davidkc0/Simple-Tipper), and you were there when I made my [personal website](https://github.com/davidkc0/personal_site), and when I made my first [Facebook Messenger bot](https://github.com/davidkc0/JeannieBot). You were there when first worked [collaboratively on a project](https://github.com/davidkc0/tapedek-), and at my [first hackathon](https://github.com/terell-brown/android-check-yo-self). Through all of this Github has made it easier for me to grow as a programmer and most importantly as a person. I have learned to become a better communicator and collaborator. Because of Github I realized that coding isn't just something you  do locked up in a dark room by yourself, but it can also be a social experience through peer programming. Im so excited at the opportunity to intern at a place that has had such a positive impact on me, and the chance to try and do the same for others. Github is such a wonderful product, and even if I don't get the chance to work with all of you this upcoming summer, I will definitely continue to spread the good word of Github wherever I go.

All the best, 

David K. Ciaffoni
